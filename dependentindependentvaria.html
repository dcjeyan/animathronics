<br>

<font color="orange"size="21"><center>Variable</font><center><font color="white"size="16">A variable is a symbol that may take different
values. It is usually represented by letters like a, b, m, n, p, x, and y.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="21">Independent Variable</font><center><font color="white"size="16">It is a variable that stands alone and whose value does not depend on the other variable. It may also refer as the input of the function.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="21">Dependent Variable</font><center><font color="white"size="16">It is something that depends on other factors. It is affected by the changes on the independent variable. It may also refer as the output of the function.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="16"><center>FOR EXAMPLE:</font>
<font color="white"size="16">A.) Karina counted the number of books in front of her to calculate how long would it take her to read all of it.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="16">Independent Variable:</font><font color="white"size="16">The number of books that karina would read</font><br>
<font color="orange"size="16">Dependent Variable:</font><font color="white"size="16">how long would it take her to read all of it</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="16"><center>FOR EXAMPLE:</font>
<font color="white"size="16">B.) Giselle checked all of her unaccomplished task to estimate how much time would it take her to finish her outputs. </font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="16">Independent Variable:</font><font color="white"size="16">All of her unaccomplished task that needs to be finished</font><br>
<font color="orange"size="16">Dependent Variable:</font><font color="white"size="16">How much time would it take her to finish her outputs</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="16"><center>FOR EXAMPLE:</font>
<font color="white"size="16">C.)Before going back home, Yizhuo decided to measure how much time would it took her to go to her destination while driving her bike at a constant speed</font>

<font color="orange"size="16">Independent Variable:</font><font color="white"size="16">Driving her bike at a constant speed</font><br>
