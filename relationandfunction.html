<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow" size="21"><center>Relation - is any set of ordered pairs. The set of all x-values is called the domain of the relation. The set of all y-values is called the range of the relation.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="white"><center>FOR EXAMPLE:
<h2><font color="white"size="16">Winter drives her bike in a daily basis, her bike can drive on a speed of 135 km/h at top speed.<br></font>
<br>
<font color="orange"><center>QUESTION:</font><br> <font color="white"><center>1.)How many kilometers would Winter reach if she drives her bike 2 hours a day? How
about 3 hours? 4 hours? or 5 hours?<br>
<br>
To solve this, let us express each given into an ordered pair and determine its Domain and Range<br>
<br>
Explanation: The distance that Winter would reach depends on how much time she would travel. 2 hrs = 270 km, 3 hrs = 405 km, 4 hrs = 540 km, and 5 hrs = 675 km.<br>
in ordered pair: (2,270),(3,405),(4,540),(5,675)<br>
<br>
Now that we got our ordered pair, we can now identify its Domain and Range<br>
Domain: {2,3,4,5} Range: {270,405,540,675}</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="yellow"size="21"><center>
Alright! We solved its Domain and range, now, let's present this example using two other ways: Mapping and Table of Values.</font>
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="21"><center>MAPPING</font><br>
<font color="white">Mapping uses an oval shape connected by a line, the first oval contains the x (Domain) while the second oval contains the y (Range). A Mapping Diagram looks like this:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Now, let us use our previous example in this diagram.<br>
Since our Domain is {2,3,4,5} and the Range is {270,405,540,675}, the domain would be placed inside the first oval while the range would be placed on the second.
<br>
<br>

The mapping should look like this.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange"size="21"><center>TABLE OF VALUES</center></font><br>
The table describes clearly the behavior of the value of y as the value of x changes. Tables can be generated based on the graph. Below is an example of a table of values, they can be either vertical or horizontal.
<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">Vertical</font>

<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">Horizontal</font>

<br>
<br>
Now, let's use our example in Table of Values.
<br>
<br>

<br>
The domain of a relation is the set of all x-values while the range is the set of all y-values.
